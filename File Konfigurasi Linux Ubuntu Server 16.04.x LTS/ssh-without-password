First:
upb@samba:/home/staffoffice$ ssh-keygen 

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/upb/.ssh/id_rsa): *default enter
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): *default enter
Enter same passphrase again: *default enter
Your identification has been saved in /home/upb/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/upb/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:32gwnRLAIjCp2HGXforXp3Q+NPP8lfCwH8TD/ZPP7Is upb@samba
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

Second:
upb@samba:/home/staffoffice$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 6006 172.16.3.106

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/upb/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '6006' '172.16.3.106'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


if Not Working Try this
samba@upb:~$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 6006 backupd@172.16.3.130
